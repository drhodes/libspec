# Examples

This directory contains a collection of examples demonstrating the use of `libspec`. Each example is a self-contained project with its own set of files.

## a bank account

A simple bank account application implemented in Go, Python, and Rust. This example showcases how to use `libspec` to specify and test the behavior of a bank account.

## command line

A command-line interface (CLI) application implemented in Go and Python. This example demonstrates how to use `libspec` to specify and test the behavior of a CLI application.

## temperature conversion

A Python application for converting temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. This example illustrates how to use `libspec` to specify and test a simple computational function.

## tic-tac-toe

A command-line tic-tac-toe game implemented in Python. This example includes different versions of the game developed by different AI models (Claude and Gemini), demonstrating how `libspec` can be used to compare and verify different implementations of the same specification.

## tic-tac-toe-urwid

A tic-tac-toe game with a more advanced terminal user interface (TUI) using the `urwid` library. This example includes implementations from different AI models (Claude, Gemini, and Groq) and shows how `libspec` can be used to test applications with more complex user interfaces.

## a to-do list

A to-do list application implemented in Python. This example includes implementations from different AI models (Claude and Groq) and demonstrates how to use `libspec` to specify and test the behavior of a simple stateful application.
